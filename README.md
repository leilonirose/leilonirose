- <h1> 👋 Hi, I’m @leilonirose <h1>
  
  <font size="16"> <p> <font size="16"> I am new to the coding world and am extremely excited to learn everything I can about the tech world. Like others have mentioned, I was hesitant to enter coding because I thought it was hard and boring. But that couldn't be further from the truth. I didn't realize how much freedom there is in coding, design, and software development nor has there been much visibility for women in tech in my area. It is as if a whole new world has open up that I didn't know existed or was for people like me. I am passionate about helping other people and am excited to see how I can help others, especially marginalized folks in the world of tech. <p> </font>
